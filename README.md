# Normal-Modes-of-the-1D-Earth
Exploring the concept of normal modes of vibration in a simplified one-dimensional Earth model. By positioning sources and receivers at different locations, the study shows how certain eigenfrequencies vanish when they coincide with the nodes of mode shapes. Both uniform velocity models and layered models with varying velocities are tested to demonstrate how medium properties affect recorded spectra.

Key Focus: Zero frequencies in recorded spectra, missing modes, and source/receiver placement effects.

Learning Outcome: Understanding the physical meaning of normal modes and how they relate to seismic observations.
